*Git* our you are in the repos 
Compressed be your *commits*. 
Come to us your *log* 
In the local as in the *remote* 
Give us today our *pull* of every day 
Forgive us our *conflicts* 
As we also forgive those of other geeks 
Don't let us fall into *detached HEAD* 
and deliver us from *SVN*.
`git commit --amend`
